<BR>In order to move a peon or a king, click on it using the left mouse button.
<BR>Please note that you can only move your peons, and only when it is your turn to move.
<BR>After clicking on the peon, you will be able to see on which squares this peon can land.
<BR>(Note: If one of your peons can capture an opponent peon, all your peons that cannot capture are not allowed to move.)
<BR>The selected peon is marked with a black border.

<BR>In order to move the peon, click on the target square.
<BR>
<BR><U>How to make complex moves?</U>
<BR>If the selected peon or king can continue jumping from the target square it must do so.
<BR>Therfore, you cannot end the move on the target square.
<BR>In order to make a complex move, you will have to right-click on every square on the path.
<BR>When a square is added to the path, a small peon appears on the square.
<BR>To perform the move, left-click on the last sqaure in the path.

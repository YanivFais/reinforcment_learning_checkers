<H1>Checkers Rules</H1>
Checkers is probably the best known game in the world.
This game is an implementation of the game known as "American Checkers", or "British Draughts".
<BR>
<H2>Moves of the Peons</H2>
<BR>
The peons can move on each empty forward left and forward right if it is empty.
When they arrive on the last line, they become kings.
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Move of the Kings</H2>
<BR>
The kings can move on each empty square around them (forward and backward).
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Captures</H2>
<BR>
If you have the choice between several captures, you can choose the one that you want (maximum or not maximum) ;
but you can only stop in a square where there is nothing more to capture.
<BR>
<BR><U>Capture by the Peons</U>:
<BR>
The peons can capture forward only, by jumping over the opponent piece (peon or king),
if the piece is near it, and the following square is empty.
If they can jump again from the arrival square, they must continue the capture.
You will see easily that the higher number of pieces that they can capture in a row is 3.
<BR>
<BR><U>Capture by the Kings</U>:
<BR>
The kings can capture like the peons, but forward and backward.
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Winner and Loser</H2>
<BR>
The loser is the one who cannot move any more (no piece or all pieces blocked).
The winner is his opponent, of course.
<BR>
There may be draw if :
<BR>- opponents agree for a draw
<BR>- the same position is encountered 3 times
<BR>
